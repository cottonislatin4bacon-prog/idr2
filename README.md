<p>this is a website i have coded for the second part of my on going project, <i>idle talk radio</i>, which began in february 2022. this repository contains the html code, and the logo image needed to "recreate" and access the website with it's contents locally on your computer. <br> the audio file is currently hosted online, but might medit the html and add the file to the reprository if problems arise.</p>
